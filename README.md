# C Doubly Linked List

This is an implementation of a doubly linked list in the programming language C.

The current features of my implementation are:

- create dll
- traverse dll
- search dll
- create node
- add first node
- add begin
- add end
- add after
- free node
- delete
- delete first
- delete last
- destroy dll
- reverse dll
- sort dll
- print dll

The file interactive.c provides a little command line like interface to test the features.
